            In order to learn more efficiently, I looked for professional
            support and chose the Developer Academy in Munich. In addition to my
            main job, I quickly acquired the basic knowledge of front-end web
            development through individual and team projects. I also
            successfully completed my certificate at SAP as an ABAP HANA
            specialist.
